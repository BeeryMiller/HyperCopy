                      ILACEO = interlace for output disk

  BL   @FORMAT Formats disk (Writes SEC0 to sector 0 and nulls to sector 1)
                 In:  OUTDRV = drive to format (byte)
                      SIDES  = sides - 1 or 2 (byte)
                      DENS   = density - 1 or 2 (byte)
                      TRACKS = tracks - 40 or 80 (byte)
                      ILACEO = interlace (byte) - ignored if logical drive
                      SKEWO  = skew (byte) - ignored if logical drive

  BL   @GPI    Gets sector 0, skew, and interlace of input disk
                 In:  INDRV  = drive number
                 Out: SKEWI  = skew
                      ILACEI = interlace
                      NUMTRK = number of tracks can store in memory

  BL   @GPO    Gets skew and interlace of output disk
                 In:  OUTDRV = drive number
                 Out: SKEWO  = skew
                      ILACEO = interlace

  BL   @SETUP  Required for initializing certain values used by COPY,
                 WRITE, and FORMAT.

  DATA RREG    MSBy is track number on BL @READ operation

  DATA WREG    MSBy is track number on BL @WRITE operation

  DATA NUMTRK  Word is number of tracks can store in memory
