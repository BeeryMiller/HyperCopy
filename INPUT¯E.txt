       BLWP @INPUT            Read a line from screen.
                                In: R0 = VDP address
                                    R1 = CPU address (length byte first)
                                    R2 = maximum length
                                    DATA validation pointer
                                Whatever is currently in the CPU buffer
                                  will be displayed on entry.
                                If R2 = 1, then <ENTER> will not be
                                  required.
                                If <ESC>, F9, up arrow, or down arrow
                                    is used, the key value used to abort
                                    will be stored in the MSBy of the
                                    calling R2. The EQ bit will be set.
                                If validation pointer is >0000, key mode
                                  5 will be used and no checking of
                                  chatacters will be done.
                                If validation pointer is not >0000, then
                                  any key pressed will be checked to see
                                  if it is in the list pointed to by the
                                  validation pointer (the list is
                                  terminated with >00). If the key is not
                                  in the list, it is ignored.

       DATA FCTNX             If >FFFF, then treats down arrow as <ENTER>
                                key. If >0000, treats as any other abort
                                key.
